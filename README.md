# echOS

echOS is a work in progress x86_64, non-posix compliant kernel, how you may ask? Well that depends on what you mean by how!

## Questions
### Why?
Well if I implemented Another Unix Kernel I would not have as much fun

### B-BUhttt my programs
I'm sorry to tell you that echOS will likely never be supported by first party developers such as Firefox and the like.
